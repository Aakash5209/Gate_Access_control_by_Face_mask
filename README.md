The purpose of the "Gate Access Control with Mask Detection" project is to create an intelligent system using Python, OpenCV, and Raspberry Pi. The system is designed to enhance safety by automatically controlling gate access based on the detection of face masks. It achieves this by training a model on a dataset of positive and negative images, allowing the gate to open only when face masks are detected. This hands-free and automated approach aims to contribute to public health measures by promoting mask usage and ensuring controlled access to a particular area.
